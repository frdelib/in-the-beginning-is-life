**Aster (microtubule aster)**  
A star-shaped array of microtubules organizing pronuclear migration.  
Greek *astēr*, “star.”

Orientation of the embryo (head–tail, back–front).  
Latin *axis*, “axle.”

**Brachyury (T)**  
Transcription factor essential for mesoderm and streak formation.  
Greek *brachy-* (“short”) + *oura* (“tail”).

**Blastocyst**  
Preimplantation embryo with trophoblast and inner cell mass.  
Greek *blastos* (“germ”) + *kystis* (“bladder”).

**Blastomere**  
A cell produced during early cleavage divisions.  
Greek *blastos* (“germ”) + *meros* (“part”).

**Ca²⁺ Oscillations**  
Calcium waves triggered by fertilization; drive early cell-cycle events.

**Cleavage**  
Rapid mitotic divisions without intermediate growth.  
Old English *cleofan*, “to split.”

**Compaction**  
Tight adhesion and polarization of morula cells.  
Latin *compingere*, “to press together.”

**Cortical Granule Reaction / Zona Reaction**  
Exocytosis blocking polyspermy; establishes a new boundary.

**Cytoplasm**  
Cellular material outside the nucleus.  
Greek *kytos*, “vessel” + *plasma*, “formed substance.”

**Delocalization (criterion of emergence)**  
A property not confined to any single part of a system.  
Latin *de-* (“away”) + *locus* (“place”).

**DNA Methylation / Demethylation**  
Chemical modification regulating gene activity.

**DNMT3A/3B**  
Enzymes installing new DNA methylation patterns.

**Embryonic Genome Activation (EGA)**  
Shift from maternal transcripts to zygotic transcription.

**Epiblast / Hypoblast**  
Lineages forming embryo proper (epiblast) and signaling tissues (hypoblast).  
Greek *epi-* (“upon”), *hypo-* (“under”) + *blastos* (“germ”).

**Epigenetic Reprogramming**  
Genome-wide resetting of chromatin marks after fertilization.

**Fertilization**  
Union of gametes forming a new organism.  
Latin *fertilis*, “fruitful.”

**FGF / NODAL / WNT / BMP**  
Core signaling pathways regulating pattern formation.

**Gastrulation / Primitive Streak**  
Formation of germ layers through coordinated cell movement.  
Greek *gaster*, “belly.”

**Genome (paternal/maternal pronuclei)**  
Genetic material contributed by gametes.

**HLA-G / HLA-E / HLA-F**  
Non-classical HLAs promoting maternal–fetal immune tolerance.

**ICM — Inner Cell Mass**  
Cluster of cells that will form the embryo proper.

**Implantation**  
Embedding of the blastocyst in the uterine lining.  
Latin *implanto*, “to plant in.”

**IZUMO1**  
Sperm protein enabling fusion with oocyte.  
Named after Izumo-taisha, Shinto shrine linked to marriage.



**JUNO**  
Oocyte receptor for IZUMO1.  
Named after Juno, Roman goddess of marriage and childbirth.

**Lineage Segregation**  
Differentiation of early embryonic cells into stable fates.

**Meiosis**  
Gamete-producing cell division halving chromosome number.  
Greek *meiōsis*, “diminution.”

**Metaphase / Anaphase / Telophase**  
Stages of mitosis: alignment, separation, and reassembly of nuclei.

**Mitochondrial Inheritance**  
Maternal transmission of mitochondria to the embryo.

**Neural Induction / Neural Plate**  
Initiation of neural tissue in response to organizer signals.

**Nuclear Transfer (SCNT)**  
Reprogramming a somatic nucleus using oocyte cytoplasm.

**Oocyte**  
Female gamete supplying cytoplasmic machinery.  
Greek *ōon*, “egg” + *kytos*, “cell.”

**Organizer (Node)**  
Signaling center that patterns midline and neural structures.

**PLCζ**  
Sperm enzyme triggering Ca²⁺ oscillations.

**Pluripotency / Totipotency**  
Ability to form many (*pluri-*) or all (*toti-*) cell types.

**Pronucleus**  
Haploid nucleus of gamete prior to fusion.  
Latin *pro-*, “before” + *nucleus*, “kernel.”

**REST**  
Transcriptional repressor preventing premature neural gene activation.

**SCMC — Subcortical Maternal Complex**  
Oocyte-localized protein complex required for early embryonic progression.

Microtubule apparatus segregating chromosomes.

**TET Enzymes (TET1/2/3)**  
Dioxygenases erasing DNA methylation marks.

**Telomere / Telomerase**  
Chromosome ends and the enzyme maintaining them.  
Greek *telos*, “end.”

Outer layer forming placenta and maternal-fetal interface.  
Greek *trophē*, “nourishment.”

**Zona Pellucida**  
Glycoprotein coat protecting the oocyte and early embryo.  
Latin *zona*, “belt” + *pellucidus*, “transparent.”
